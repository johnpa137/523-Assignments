A simple to do list app. Initially populated with a single blank task and the title text To Do List.
There's a button on the bottom right corner of the screen to add a task to the to do list.
For each task, there's an text box to define or describe the task; there's a button to set a time for when task's completion is due which launches a widget to select a time; the task text can be clicked to strike through the task to indicate its completion; and there's a button to delete a task from the list. 

This took 2-3 hours to build. 

The most challenging parts were trying to get the GUI to behave and size correctly as I'd like. The constraintlayout was useful for this.
